# Telegram Bot on Cloudflare Workers

A minimal example of a Telegram Bot running on a Cloudflare Worker.

## Setup:

1. Get your new bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather): https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather
2. Sign up to Cloudflare Workers: https://workers.cloudflare.com/
3. In the Cloudflare Dashboard go to "Workers" and then click "Create a Service"
4. Choose a name and click "Create a Service" to create the worker
5. Click on "Quick Edit" to change the source code of your new worker
6. Copy and paste the code from [bot.js](bot.js) into the editor
7. Replace the `TOKEN` variable in the code with your token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
8. Optional: Change the `WEBHOOK` variable to a different path and the `SECRET` variable to a random secret. See https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook
9. Click on "Save and Deploy"
10. In the middle panel append `/registerWebhook` to the url. For example: https://my-worker-123.username.workers.dev/registerWebhook
11. Click "Send". In the right panel should appear `Ok`. If 401 Unauthorized appears, you may have used a wrong bot token.
12. That's it, now you can send a text message to your Telegram bot

## Bot behaviour

The bot will send the original message back with `Echo:` prepended.
If you want to change it, look at the function `onMessage()`. It receives a [Message](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#message) object and sends a text back:

```javascript
/**
 * Handle incoming Message
 * https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#message
 */
function onMessage (message) {
  return sendPlainText(message.chat.id, 'Echo:\n' + message.text)
}
```
